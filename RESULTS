# Definition

Turnaround: duration from job arrival until job completion.
Slowdown: the ratio of turnaround to the job size.



# 0.1 workload

The average job interarrival time is 1, while the average job size is 0.1.
Since job sizes are quite tiny, most jobs could be completed before the next job arrives.

## Mean of Turnaround

Therefore, the average turnaround should be very close to the average job size 0.1, regardless of the choice of scheduler.
Actually, the average turnaround of different schedulers roughly ranges between 0.11 and 0.12.

## Variance of Turnaround

Besides, the turnaround variance should be a relatively tiny value, since the turnaround of each job doesn't vary too much.
Simiarlly, the turnaround variance of different schedulers roughly ranges between 0.11 and 0.12.

## Mean of Slowdown

Although the average job size is tiny, we can still some relatively large jobs.

1. FIFO (average slowdown=1.55) and SJF (average slowdown=1.52) schedulers are non-preemptive, those jobs come after large jobs
   have to wait for the large ones to finish. This will hurt the slowdown of those waiting jobs (make the slowdown larger), 
   which make the average slowdown larger.

2. The execution order of PRIORITY (average slowdown=1.41) is influenced by the static priority of the jobs. If a series of large 
   jobs of high priority come before a tiny job of low priority, the tiny job will be preempted and have to wait for a long time. 
   Scenarios like this would hurt the average slowdown, make it not as good as that of SPRT, RR, STRIDE.

3. SRPT (average slowdown=1.04), RR(average slowdown=1.14) and STRIDE (average slowdown=1.15) prefers tiny jobs. tiny jobs will be
   executed soon after they arrive, which will cause a better slowdown (better means smaller slowdown) for that job. Since tiny 
   jobs are the majority of 0.1 workload, these algorithms will have good average slowdown. 

## Variance of Slowdown

In the discussion above, we could observe that schedulers with good average slowdown (SRPT, RR, STRIDE) could always complete tiny 
jobs quickly. In contrast, schedulers with bad average slowdown (FIFO, SJF, PRIORITY) could sometimes make a tiny job wait for the
completion of a large one.

In other words, good average slowdown corresponds with small slowdown for almost each job, leading to smaller slowdown variance.
SRPT(stddev slowdown=0.15), RR(stddev slowdown=0.47), STRIDE(stddev slowdown=0.62)

While in scheduler with bad average slowdown, tiny jobs will probablely have larger slowdown than large jobs, which leads to 
larger slowdown variance.
FIFO(stddev slowdown=4.40), SJF(stddev slowdown=4.37), PRIORITY(stddev slowdown=3.51)



# 0.5 workload

The average job interarrival time is 1, while the average job size is 0.5.
Job sizes are no longer "tiny", but still relatively small.
However, jobs have a higher chance to wait for the completion of previous jobs.

## Mean of Turnaround

Since 0.5 is still relatively small, when a job arrives, it is usually the only job in the job queue, 
waiting for the completionof the running job. 

1. With FIFO(average turnaround=1.09) and SJF(average turnaround=0.94), the turnaround is the remaining size of the running
   job plus the size of the new job, which is roughly twice the average job size, hence approximately 1. With SPRT(average 
   turnaround=0.77) scheduler, the preemptive property makes sure that small jobs don't need to wait for large ones.
   Therefore we could have a better average turnaround time.

2. RR(average turnaround=1.10) and STRIDE(average turnaround=1.12) allow the newly arriving job share system resources with 
   the running job. Since they are usually the only two jobs waiting for being executed, the turnaround time for one job is
   also roughly twice the average job size.

3. PRIORITY(average turnaround=1.15) would somtimes make small job wait for large ones, or allow the opposite. Since the 
   average job size is still relatively small, the average turnaround is very close to the metric from other schedulers.

## Variance of Turnaround

1. The turnaround time for each job in FIFO(stddev turnaround=0.95) and SJF(stddev turnaround=0.95) scheduler does not vary
   too much, hence the turnaround variance is not a large number.

2. SRPT(stddev turnaround=1.12), RR(stddev turnaround=1.31) and STRIDE(stddev turnaround=1.41) will lead to small turnaround
   for small jobs and large turnaround for large jobs. As a result, their turnaround variances will be larger than the former
   three schedulers.

3. PRIORITY(stddev turnaround=1.60) would make small job wait for large ones, making the turnaround of some small jobs larger.
   Since most jobs are small, this would lead to a larger variance.

## Mean of Slowdown

1. As discussed above, SRPT (average slowdown=1.24), RR(average slowdown=2.24) and STRIDE (average slowdown=2.80) "will lead 
   to small turnaround for small jobs and large turnaround for large jobs". This is a sign for not only good turnaround 
   variance but also good average slowdown since it means small slowdown for each job.

2. Compareds with workload 0.1, FIFO (average slowdown=18.03) and SJF (average slowdown=15.70) schedulers are more likely make
   small jobs wait, and would make them wait longer, which would cause huge increase of slowdown for small jobs. This is the 
   source of the growing average slowdown.

3. The static priority of PRIORITY (average slowdown=1.41) scheduler could to some degree help reduce the problems of FIFO and
   SJF. By assigning higher static priority for small jobs, it achieves a better average slowdown than these two schedulers.

## Variance of Slowdown

1. Just for reminder, SRPT(stddev slowdown=0.53), RR(stddev slowdown=2.64), STRIDE(stddev slowdown=6.90) could provide small 
   slowdown for every job. This property naturally leads to small slowdown variance for these three schedulers.

2. According to previous discussions, FIFO(stddev slowdown=275.69), SJF(stddev slowdown=274.94) woud cause much larger slowdown
   for small jobs. Since the worklist is composed of mainly small job, this would be a disaster for slowdown variance.

3. PRIORITY(stddev slowdown=33.09) could reduce the problems of FIFO and SJF with static priority, but it could not do a job as 
   good as other jobs such as SRPT. The slowdown variance of PRIORITY is in between.



# 0.9 / 0.95 / 0.99 workload

The analyses for workload 0.9 / 0.95 / 0.99 are similar since these three numbers of job size are all close to 1 (the average 
job interarrival time). Just for simplicity, our discussion will focus on the intermediate level, workload 0.95, which we
believe is representative.

The average job interarrival time is 1, while the average job size is 0.95.
The average job size is almost 1, jobs have a huge chance to wait for the completion of previous jobs.

## Mean of Turnaround

1. SJF(average turnaround=7.27) and SPRT(average turnaround=6.61) would always prioritize the execution of small jobs. With an
   increasing system workload, this property would a huge improvement for average turnaround because it helps reduce the 
   turnaround for small jobs significantly.

2. RR(average turnaround=22.12) and STRIDE(average turnaround=22.58) almost have the same average turnaround as FIFO(average 
   turnaround=22.11). This is because there are so many jobs waiting in the job queue. To be more specific, FIFO will make the 
   job wait for the completion of previous jobs. On the other hand, although RR could execute a job before the completion of 
   former jobs, it will also let it share system resouces with jobs come after it, and consequently slow down the execution 
   speed for this job. 

3. PRIORITY(average turnaround=24.04) introduce static priority to adjust the execution order of jobs, which is a double-edged 
   sword. It could optimize the scheduling by assigning higher priority to small jobs or make the situation worse by making 
   small jobs waiting for a long time after a series of large jobs. With a huge enough worklist, these influces just cancel 
   out each other, making the average turnaround close to that of FIFO scheduler. 

## Variance of Turnaround

1. Since there are too many jobs waiting in the job queue, the waiting time mainly contribute to the turnaround for each job
   and the difference of job size become relatively insignificant in FIFO(stddev turnaround=11.12) scheduler. As a result, 
   the turnaround variance in FIFO is not as significant as in other schedulers. 

2. SJF(stddev turnaround=24.63), SRPT(stddev turnaround=26.59), RR(stddev turnaround=25.05) would complete small jobs first, 
   while let large jobs wait. This strategy would cause an increase of turnaround variance.

3. PRIORITY(stddev turnaround=54.04) reply on static priority for scheduling tasks. It turns out that this strategy is not 
   very flexible, therefore the turnaround for different jobs would vary widely.

4. STRIDE(stddev turnaround=42.52) is the tradeoff between RR and PRIORITY, hence the performance is also between these 
   two schedulers.

## Mean of Slowdown

1. SRPT(average slowdown=2.74) has best average slowdown beacause it could prioritize the scheduling of small jobs. On the 
   other hand, even though SJF(average slowdown=24.63) shares this strategy, it would sometimes let small jobs wait for the 
   completion of large jobs since it is not preemptive. As a result, it could not achieve as good average slowdown as SRPT.

2. RR(average slowdown=25.90) and STRIDE(average slowdown=28.35) would also allow small jobs to be executed earlier. However,
   since they are sharing system resources with other jobs, the execution speed will get slow, which would hurt the average 
   slowdown metric. Besides, since STRIDE uses the dynamic priority of the current job to set the new coming job, a small job
   would sometimes be assigned a high dynamic priority, which means the small job will be handled quite later and this is not 
   a good news for the average slowdown.

3. Different from STRIDE, PRIORITY(average slowdown=183.63) scheduler relies solely on static priority. This property makes 
   PRIORITY is somewhat more clumzy when handling more jobs waiting in the job queue, compared with those schedulers using 
   "shortest prioritized" strategy. Consequently, this would hurt the average slowdown.

4. As said before, the huge amount of jobs waiting in the job queue will lead to a large average slowdown in FIFO(average 
   slowdown=399.81) because the waiting time is very long compared with the job size.

## Variance of Slowdown

1. SRPT(stddev slowdown=5.82) could lead to small turnaround for small jobs and large turnaround for large jobs, which lead 
   to relatively small slowdown for every job. Therefore, SRPT would have a very small slowdown variance.
   
2. SJF(stddev slowdown=408.11) shares this strategy in general, but its non-preemptive property would cause disastrous increase
   of slowdown for small jobs, which would finally hurt the slowdown variance. Actually. stddev slowdown=408.11 in workload 0.95
   is much worse than the metric of workload 0.99 (stddev slowdown=245.24) and even workload 1.5(stddev slowdown=304.42). This 
   weird data may be caused by the distribution of incoming jobs and shows that the waiting strategy is problematic.

3. RR(stddev slowdown=25.90), STRIDE(stddev slowdown=28.35) would distribute system resouces for each job. The turnaround time
   for each job is larger then that of SRPT, and is roughly proportional to the job size. This would lead to a larger slowdown 
   variance than SRPT, but still quite acceptable.

4. The slowdown of each job in FIFO(stddev slowodwn=4546.19) is very large, and the variance grow exponentially as well.

5. PRIORITY(stddev slowdown=183.63) is just "medicore" since it could not do as good a job as SRPT. But it was also unable to 
   make the situation extremely terrible just as FIFO beacuse the static priority could help relieve the problem of waiting. 



# 1.5 workload

The average job interarrival time is 1, while the average job size is 1.5.
The average job size is greater than 1, jobs are "destined" to wait for the completion of previous jobs.

Actually, the analyses for 1.5 workload extremely resemble the analyses for 0.95 workload because the behaviors of schedulers 
are similar. When saying "similar", we mean in both cases schedulers must handle the long waiting line since the average job 
size is no more tiny (e.g. 0.1) compared with 1.

However, with 1.5 workload, the difference among result data of schedulers is just more obvious.

## Mean of Turnaround

Similar to the analyses for 0.95 workload:

1. SJF(average turnaround=97.44) and SPRT(average turnaround=97.02) prioritize the execution of small jobs, which leads to best 
   average turnaround.

2. RR(average turnaround=310.74) and STRIDE(average turnaround=314.75) almost have the same average turnaround as FIFO(average 
   turnaround=309.35). This is because in FIFO, jobs wait for the completion of previous jobs in the job queue; in RR and STRIDE,
   although being executed soon, jobs can only use a small fraction of system resources and the execution may be slow. 

3. The beneficial and detrimental effects of PRIORITY(average turnaround=325.51) just cancel out each other, making the average 
   turnaround close to the "baseline", i.e. the metric of FIFO scheduler.

## Variance of Turnaround

Similar to the analyses for 0.95 workload:

1. The waiting time mainly contribute to the turnaround for each job in FIFO(stddev turnaround=166.57). As a result, the turnaround 
   variance in FIFO is not as significant as in other schedulers. 

2. SJF(stddev turnaround=273.68), SRPT(stddev turnaround=273.89), RR(stddev turnaround=295.45) complete small jobs first and let 
   large jobs wait, which causes an increase of turnaround variance.

3. PRIORITY(stddev turnaround=426.54) uses static priority, which is not flexible enough for complicated situation. Consequently,
   the turnaround for different jobs would vary widely, leading to a larger turnaround variance.

4. As said before, the turnaround variance of STRIDE(stddev turnaround=329.33) is just between RR and PRIORITY.

## Mean of Slowdown

Similar to the analyses for 0.95 workload:

1. SRPT(average slowdown=21.24) achieves best average slowdown by prioritizing the scheduling of small jobs. SJF(average 
   slowdown=97.44) is unable to be equally optimized owing to the non-preemptive property.

2. RR(average slowdown=219.58) and STRIDE(average slowdown=283.33) would execute small jobs in a relatively slow speed, hence 
   it will hurt the average slowdown. And the dynamic priority of STRIDE may postpone the execution of small jobs, which would 
   make a poorer performance.

3. PRIORITY(average slowdown=1563.47) is not flexiblae enough to handle many jobs waiting in the job queue, which leads to bad
   average slowdown.

4. FIFO(average slowdown=3545.33) has a extremely long job queue, the waiting time is very long compared with the job size. This 
   is the source of the large average slowdown.

## Variance of Slowdown

Similar to the analyses for 0.95 workload:

1. The turnaround time assigned by SRPT(stddev slowdown=54.60) for jobs are roughly proportional to job sizes. This leads to 
   relatively small slowdown for every job and the smallest slowdown variance.
   
2. The non-preemptive property of SJF(stddev slowdown=304.42) is problematic and would cause disastrous increase of slowdown 
   for small jobs with unsuitable incoming jobs, which would finally hurt the slowdown variance.

2. RR(stddev slowdown=255.13), STRIDE(stddev slowdown=510.17) allow jobs to share system resources. Although roughly proportional 
   to the job size, the slowdown for each job is larger then that of SRPT. Hence we have a larger slowdown variance than SRPT.

3. The slowdown of each job in FIFO(stddev slowodwn=41819.18) is unacceptable because the extremely long job queue.

4. PRIORITY(stddev slowdown=17533.49) could not handle complicated situations with static priority. Although not as bad as FIFO, 
   the slowdown variance of PRIORITY is extremely terrible.
